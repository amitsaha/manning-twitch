Introduction

Hi everyone, my name is Amit Saha. I work as a software engineer at Atlassian, located in Sydney, Australia, and I write books on software. 

I am the creator of a few live projects for Manning. These live projects aim to guide you how to use the Go programming language to solve some potentially common problems that you may be solving as a software engineer. My key goal for these projects is for Go language learners, such as yourself, to apply their newly acquired Go skills to create a potentially useful application at the end which they can then extend to their more custom use cases.

Today’s session

In this stream I will cover a few techniques that are covered across my live projects including “Creating a web application scaffold generator in Go”. 

I will start off with a basic walkthrough of creating a Go module. Starting with Go 1.16, all Go applications must be written as a module. We will start off with a module which accepts interactive input from the user. We will learn about the io.Reader interface and how to test such an application.

Next, we will see an example of how we can write our application as consisting of multiple packages. We will also see an example of using a third party package.

Then, we will learn about defining flags in our applications.  We will look at testing such applications. We will learn about the io.Writer interface and learn how we can test standard output in our applications.

Then, we will take a look at defining HTTP servers, use the embed package to embed static assets into servers. Finally, we will look at a few techniques to write tests for it.

Ideas for extending the project

If you completed the web application scaffold generator project, you could now work on extending the project so that the web application scaffold uses the embed package in the generated scaffold.
